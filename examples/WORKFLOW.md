You are working on GitHub Project item {{ issue.identifier }}.

Title: {{ issue.title }}
Description: {{ issue.description }}

Requirements:
- Prefer touching tracked source files only.
- If verification commands pick up generated output or cache directories, narrow checks to the relevant source files or directories and explain that choice.
- If a patch fails because file context drifted, reread the file and retry with a narrower patch.
- Before staging changes, inspect the actual changed file list (`git status --short` and/or `git diff --name-only`) and stage only files that currently exist.
- Do not guess file paths during `git add`; if a path is missing, re-check the worktree and use the exact existing paths.
- If a lockfile-aware install fails only because your intentional dependency edits require a lockfile update, explain that and fall back to the normal install flow instead of stopping immediately.
- For multi-surface features, it is acceptable to finish one coherent slice first (for example backend plus tests) instead of leaving a broad partial patch across backend and frontend.

Follow the repository's coding standards. Write tests for new functionality.
Create a pull request when the implementation is complete.
