# Symphony for GitHub Projects

- **日本語 README:** [README-ja.md](./README-ja.md)

A TypeScript implementation of [Symphony](https://github.com/openai/symphony) targeting
**GitHub Projects** as the issue tracker, based on the
[Symphony SPEC](https://github.com/openai/symphony/blob/main/SPEC.md).

Symphony turns project work into isolated, autonomous implementation runs — allowing teams to
manage work instead of supervising coding agents. The upstream reference implementation uses Linear
as its tracker; this project adapts the same architecture for GitHub Projects.

> **Status:** Engineering preview. Suitable for evaluation in trusted environments.

## Running Symphony for GitHub Projects

### Option 1. Make your own

Tell your favorite coding agent to build Symphony for GitHub Projects in a programming language of your choice:

> Implement Symphony for GitHub Projects according to the following spec:
> https://github.com/t0yohei/symphony-github-projects/blob/main/SPEC.md

### Option 2. Use our experimental reference implementation

Check out this repository as an experimental reference implementation and start with:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/t0yohei/symphony-github-projects.git
cd symphony-github-projects
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```

You can also ask a coding agent to help with setup:

> Set up Symphony for GitHub Projects for my repository based on
> https://github.com/t0yohei/symphony-github-projects/blob/main/SPEC.md

You can use the included GitHub Actions workflow as a smoke-check baseline (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`).

## How It Works

```
GitHub Projects (issue tracker)
    ↓  polling (configurable interval)
Symphony Orchestrator
    ↓  per-issue workspace isolation
    ↓  launches coding agent (Codex app-server)
Coding Agent
    ↓  implements changes, creates PRs
GitHub Projects status updated
```

1. **Poll** — The orchestrator polls a GitHub Project board for items in active states (e.g. `Todo`, `In Progress`).
2. **Isolate** — Each work item gets a dedicated workspace directory, bootstrapped via configurable hooks.
3. **Dispatch** — A coding agent (Codex in app-server mode) is launched inside the workspace with a rendered prompt.
4. **Multi-turn** — The agent works through multiple turns (up to `max_turns`) until the task is complete.
5. **Reconcile** — On every tick the orchestrator checks tracker state; if an item moves to a terminal state, the agent is stopped and the workspace is cleaned up.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** ≥ 20
- **GitHub token** with access to the target repository and project board
- **Codex CLI** installed and available as `codex app-server` (or a custom command)
- A GitHub Project (classic or ProjectV2) with status columns

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kouka-t0yohei/symphony-github-projects.git
cd symphony-github-projects
npm install
```

### 2. Set environment variables

Following this repo's [SPEC](./SPEC.md), configuration
values are resolved from runtime environment variables — not from `.env` files. Set them in your
shell before starting the service:

```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN="ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
```

The `WORKFLOW.md` front matter references these variables with `$VAR_NAME` syntax (e.g.
`tokenEnv: GITHUB_TOKEN`). The config resolver reads them from `process.env` at startup.

#### Recommended GitHub token permissions

If you use a fine-grained personal access token, scope it to the target repository (and the owning
user/org project, if applicable).

**Tracker-only mode** (read/update GitHub Projects state only):
- Projects: **Read and write**
- Metadata: **Read-only**
- Issues: **Read-only**

**Implementation mode** (same token also pushes code and opens PRs):
- Projects: **Read and write**
- Metadata: **Read-only**
- Issues: **Read and write**
- Contents: **Read and write**
- Pull requests: **Read and write**

If your workflow only reads issue metadata and never comments on issues, `Issues: Read-only` is
usually enough. If your hooks clone private repositories or your agent pushes branches / opens pull
requests, use the implementation-mode set above.

### 3. Create your WORKFLOW.md

Copy the example and customize it for your project:

```bash
cp examples/WORKFLOW.md ./WORKFLOW.md
```

A minimal `WORKFLOW.md`:

```yaml
---
tracker:
  kind: github_projects

runtime:
  poll_interval_ms: 30000
  max_concurrency: 2

workspace:
  root: ~/symphony-workspaces

hooks:
  after_create: |
    git clone git@github.com:your-org/your-repo.git .
    npm install

agent:
  command: codex app-server
  max_turns: 20
  timeouts:
    hooks_timeout_ms: 120000

extensions:
  github_projects:
    owner: your-org
    project_number: 1
    token_env: GITHUB_TOKEN
---

You are working on GitHub Project item {{ issue.identifier }}.

Title: {{ issue.title }}
Description: {{ issue.description }}

Follow the repository's coding standards. Write tests for new functionality.
Create a pull request when the implementation is complete.
```

The YAML front matter configures runtime behavior; the Markdown body is the prompt template
sent to the coding agent for each work item. Template variables use
[Liquid](https://liquidjs.com/) syntax.

### 4. Build and run

```bash
npm run build
npm start
# or
node dist/cli.js
```

### 5. Launch the local Web UI dashboard

This repo now includes a lightweight observability dashboard inspired by Symphony's Elixir dashboard.
It is served directly by the Node process and polls local runtime state every 5 seconds.

```bash
npm run dev:dashboard

# or run explicitly
npm run build
node dist/cli.js --workflow WORKFLOW.md --dashboard-port 4318
# optional: expose on a specific interface
node dist/cli.js --workflow WORKFLOW.md --dashboard-port 4318 --dashboard-host 0.0.0.0
```

Then open <http://127.0.0.1:4318>.

Current dashboard scope:
- summary metrics
- workflow metadata
- running session list
- retry queue
- latest rate-limit snapshot

## WORKFLOW.md Reference

The `WORKFLOW.md` file is the single source of truth for orchestrator behavior. It is designed
to be version-controlled alongside your code.

### Front Matter Keys

Core contract (canonical):

- `tracker.kind` — must be `github_projects`
- `runtime.poll_interval_ms` / `runtime.max_concurrency`
- `runtime.retry.{continuation_delay_ms,failure_base_delay_ms,failure_multiplier,failure_max_delay_ms}`
- `workspace.root`
- `agent.command`, `agent.args`, `agent.max_turns`
- `agent.timeouts.{turn_timeout_ms,read_timeout_ms,stall_timeout_ms,hooks_timeout_ms}`
- `hooks.{after_create,before_run,after_run,before_remove}`

Legacy note: older examples may show `hooks.timeout_ms`, but the supported location for hook timeout configuration is `agent.timeouts.hooks_timeout_ms`.

GitHub Projects extension namespace:

- `extensions.github_projects.owner`
- `extensions.github_projects.project_number`
- `extensions.github_projects.token_env`
- `extensions.github_projects.type`
- `extensions.github_projects.active_states` (optional, default: `todo`, `in_progress`, `blocked`)
- `extensions.github_projects.terminal_states` (optional, default: `done`)
- `extensions.github_projects.status_options.in_progress` (optional label text, default `In Progress`)
- `extensions.github_projects.status_options.done` (optional label text, default `Done`)
- `extensions.github_projects.mark_done_on_completion` (optional, default: `false`)

When `mark_done_on_completion: true`, a worker completion triggers `Project` state update to your configured `done` option.
If this is left `false`, completion will schedule a short continuation retry by default, which is expected for multi-turn workflows but can look like a loop in simple one-turn setups.

Compatibility mapping is built-in for existing keys (`polling.intervalMs`, `workspace.baseDir`,
`agent.maxTurns`, `tracker.github.*`, and camelCase timeout/retry fields), so older WORKFLOW files
continue to load while runtime uses one canonical typed model.

### Prompt Template

The Markdown body supports [Liquid](https://liquidjs.com/) template variables:

- `{{ issue.identifier }}` — Work item identifier
- `{{ issue.title }}` — Title
- `{{ issue.description }}` — Description/body
- `{{ issue.state }}` — Current state
- `{{ issue.labels }}` — Labels array
- `{{ attempt }}` — `null` on first run, integer on retries

Unknown variables and filters raise errors (strict mode).

### Hot Reload

The orchestrator watches `WORKFLOW.md` for changes and re-applies configuration without restart.
Invalid changes keep the last known good config and log an error.

npm run lint          # ESLint
npm run format        # Prettier (write)
npm run format:check  # Prettier (check only)
npm run typecheck     # TypeScript type check

### CI

GitHub Actions runs on PRs and `main` pushes:

- `npm ci` → `npm run lint` → `npm run test` → `npm run build`

Workflow file: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
